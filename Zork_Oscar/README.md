Guide:

To finish the game there are diferent ways to go, here is one of them:
- move east
- take key from box
- open metalDoor
- go east
- take sword
- equip sword
- take armor
- equip armor
- go south
- attack boss
- attack boss
- take goldenKey

Description:

I have develop the following additional features: RPG stats for player, dialog for creatures, 
stats for items, equip action, exits locked and opened by specific items, inspect action and inventory.

It has been tricky to get all possible input from the user 
and try to be as responsibe as possible to get outputs to the client though UI.
I also tried to make a different UI that refreshes itself and gives the game a different look.
